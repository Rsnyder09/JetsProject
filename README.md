# JetsProject

#Description

My app has a menu with 9 different options. The first option will allow you to see all the jets in the airfield. This comes from a text file that is read in initially. Option 2 will fly all jets in the airfield and shows you the jets information as well as when it will run out of fuel ( based on speed and range). Option 3 will print out the fastest jets information. Option 4 will print out the jet with the longest range. Option 5 will load all Cargo jets and print their information. Option 6 will make all Fighter jets fire missiles. Option 7 will prompt the user to enter a new jet which includes model, speed in mph, range, and price. Option 8 will remove a jet from the airfield depending on what number you select and what index the plane is in the array. Option 9 will quit the program.

#Lessons Learned 

Looking back at the weekly labs helped the most. 

I need to go over the whole weeks class because I feel like I am not fully understanding the majority of the topics. 

Parameters held me up for a while but one I found.

Eclipse errors are very helpful when you read them and they show you exactly what line is getting errors. 

Google is a very useful tool when looking into 

I was a little confused by the homework. At first, I thought fly jets was only for fighter jets and not the whole airfield. Also, there was no instructions on what to do with Dogfight in the instructions. Also I was unable to get into week 3 video recordings to reference time stamps that I wrote down. Friday recording wasn’t posted either, that is where I usually go and listen to the explanation given by the instructors about the homework. (this was all cleared up on Saturday when the TAs were able to clarify for me. I would have asked on Friday but didn’t make it that far yet so I’m very thankful we have Saturday TA hours.)

OOP makes my brain hurt and switching between classes sometimes gets me lost and very confused. (overall I do like it, I just need more time with it.) 

I don’t think I did the adding of a new jet correct. I wanted the method to be in the airfield class but we cant have a scanner in airfield so  I was unsure how to get around that and tried a bunch of different things that ended up not working. So I am only adding to my array list within the jetsApp and not in the airfield where all the jets are. I am adding jets to the jetsApp and confirmed it by printing out the array size after a new jet has been added. I am out of time though and have been working on this all weekend and cant get it to work for the life of me. 

Saturdays TA hours are the best. 

Timestamping (day and time) when instructors say they are giving hints and being able to go back to them helped me out a lot!
